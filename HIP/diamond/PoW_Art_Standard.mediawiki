==The Goal of HIP-10==

HACD currently consists of two visual displays, HIP-5 and HIP-8, and a game-like HIP-9 has also been created, which means that under certain conditions, HACD should theoretically have the possibility of countless displays, not only in visuals, but also in music and games. Then crypto geeks and artists can create HACD to enhance the innovation and artistic effects of HACD.

HACD initially consisted of 6 letters, HIP-5 gave the first visual effect of HACD. HIP-8 gave the second visual effect of HACD. Then theoretically, as long as the overall fairness of HACD is met without any changes, the new HACD visual effects can be implemented as HIP-5 and HIP-8, but the new visual effects of HACD should meet some conditions and set certain standards, which we call HIP-10 PoW Art Standard.

==HIP-10 PoW Art Standard for HACD==

HACD is a series of 6 letters and hash values generated by PoW and bidding mechanism. After HACD is generated, the above data will not be changed. Our visuals are created on the basis of these generated data. In other words, the HACD generated by mining is like a protocol for visualization or other art forms. The development of the standard we can review the principles of HIP-5 and HIP-8 implementation.

PoW art standards need to meet the following four conditions in order to be effective as a new display for HACD.

* The sum of HACD is 16777216, which means that the possibilities displayed by HACD should meet at least 16777216 or more, which must not be lower than the theoretical total number of HACD.
* Once the HACD is mined and validated, its display must be immediately available and the display is generated by established program and cannot be artificially created in a selective and subjective manner afterwards.
* The HACD rendering effect must be original, no copying or derivatives are accepted, and follow CC0 copyright.
**CC0 enables scientists, educators, artists and other creators and owners of copyright- or database-protected content to waive those interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.
* If there is scarcity in the new HACD presentation effect, then the dimensions of the predetermined scarcity probabilities must be the same in time. The scarcity remains constant, unbiased before and after, and completely random. There must not be a special scarcity design by the creator for existing HACD.

HIP-10 tends to suggest that artists use a procedurally generated SVG format to render the final artwork, based on ease of navigation and device portability, and to help reduce the storage and transmission load.

==Conclusion==

HACD follows the first principle of Bitcoin, and the artistry of its creation, due to the design of the PoW mechanism, belongs to a bottom-up, collaborative work of art, spanning a long period of time, and will be a cross-century work of art created and completed by people from all over the world.
